            <h2>Who Exactly Are You?</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Alucard Vang, and I am a student at North Hennepin Community College, majoring in computer science. I made this website to talk about a little bit about myself! I'm 21 years old and have been in Minnesota my whole life. I've worked in a few jobs and had a few adventures before coming back to school for my higher education. Going through this website, you'll go into more detail about what I have done! Welcome to my website! And yes, I like bears.</p>

            <h2>My Goals!</h2>
            <p>Currently, my goals in life are to become self-sustainable and be able to live life doing whatever I want. Unfortunately, it is tough being self-sustainable currently in the United States. Therefore, I plan to obtain a career that enables me to become self-sustainable. Do I know what I'm doing? No. I absolutely do not know what I am doing. Some would say that is the journey of life though. I do think I know somewhat what I'm doing, but I'd be a fool to say that I do.</p>
