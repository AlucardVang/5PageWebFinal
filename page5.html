            <h2>What Is A "Shower Thought"?</h2>
            <p>Google AI explains it best: "A shower thought is a sudden idea that comes to someone while they are doing a mundane activity, like taking a shower, driving, or walking. Shower thoughts can be insightful or humorous, and they are often the result of not thinking about anything in particular." I love having shower thoughts; it's one of the funniest things ever. However, sometimes if you dive too deep in your thoughts, you get to places where you might not want to be or think about. We don't talk about those thoughts.</p>

            <h2>What Are Some Shower Thoughts?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All the food dishes we cut from a circle (ex: pie, pizza, etc.), we eat from the inside out. Technically though, is it still the inside we're eating?</li>
                <li>People don't really realize how impressive cameras are. It's insane how we humans were able to use minerals from the earth to literally capture a point in time.</li>
                <li>Pavlov probably thought about feeding his dogs every time someone rang a bell.</li>
                <li>Whenever you think or hear about Pavlov, you think of a bell.</li>
                <li>11 babies have been born in Antarctica, and none of them died as infants, meaning Antarctica has the lowest infant mortality rate at 0%.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sad Shower Thoughts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Dads probably bond with dogs so much because, in our society, men don’t get shown a lot of affection but dogs give tons of affection regardless.</li>
                <li>Quitting drugs is viewed more positively than never taking them.</li>
                <li>Because of AI video generation, throughout the entire thousands of years of human history, "video proof" is only gonna be a thing for around a hundred years.</li>
                <li>The 2020s will never be confused with the Roaring ‘20s.</li>
                <li>It's cheaper to buy women's underwear new than it is to buy it used.</li>
