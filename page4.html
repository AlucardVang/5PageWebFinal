            <h2>Farmers Market</h2>
            <p>At a young age, I've worked at the farm and at the farmers market. I was never really around the farm as much as I was in the farmers market. I worked there very young, always with my family or relatives. I remember working there at dawn until late in the afternoon. The work just never ended. One day at the market and the next at the farm preparing for the market the next day. I swear, I was a victim of child labor! Haha! I was also a victim of being paid less than minimum wage! I worked all day just to get $20! At the end of the day, I'm happy I worked there! It made me money as a kid and I worked to get what I wanted.</p>

            <h2>ARMY</h2>
            <p>Yeah, I joined the Minnesota Army National Guard at the ripe age of 19. A recruiter told me I could get a Dodge Charger and I signed the paper. Did I ever get a Dodge Charger? Hell no! Did I get to do a lot of cool stuff? Hell yeah. Honestly though, I joined because I wanted to. I felt like I had nothing and couldn't decide on what to do. I joined the Army for the opportunities and it was worth it. I made friends and memories I will never forget!</p>

            <h2>Where Do I Work Now?</h2>
            <p>Currently, I am a full-time student but I am also working currently as well. I am a personal caretaker, meaning that I assist people in need with daily things. The pay isn't crazy, but money is money. I don't plan to stick in this field personally, but I do enjoy the aspect of helping people. Like I said in Page 1, I plan to move into cybersecurity and possibly build a career there. A dream job for me really would be a content creator, as I think that it's a job I'd really enjoy doing!</p>
