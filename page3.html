            <h2>Music As A Kid</h2>
            <p>My family is a VERY musical family. Most of every single person in my family has used an instrument. I, Alucard Vang, was the pianist. Although I didn't like the piano, it's an amazing instrument. It was just unfortunate that I was forced to learn it from a young age. Who would've thought! Forcing kids to learn something they hate doing! I am happy I learned the piano; however, I love the piano and it made me appreciate much more about how music is played!</p>

            <h2>Joining The High School Band</h2>
            <p>Yeah, I know, unfortunately, I was a high school band kid. I will say though that I was not one of the weird people. I swear. I played the flute and a little bit of the tuba at the end. I stayed in the band for 3 years, and it consisted of marching and concert. It was a fun time! When everyone got everything right, every piece sounds amazing!</p>

            <h2>What Do I Listen To?</h2>
            <p>The big old question, I listen to whatever fits the mood honestly. There isn't a single genre that I don't listen to. Except for country. I'm messing, country has some good songs too. If I had to choose one genre, it would probably be pop. If I had the option to remove one genre, it would definitely be country. I don't hate country, but it probably is my least listened to genre. I'm not going to lie though; "Wagon Wheel" hits perfectly, the song is so good. I am also a sucker for movie and game official sound tracks! I love so many OSTs that games have released!</p>
